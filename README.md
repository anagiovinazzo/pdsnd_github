# US Bikeshare Data Exploration with Python

## Project Overview
This project, which originated from Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python course, makes use of Python code and the pandas library to explore user data for a bike share company in three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

### Data Analyzed
* Most frequent times of travel (e.g. month, day of the week, hour of the day)
* Station usage metrics (e.g. most popular start and end stations)
* Trip duration statistics (e.g. length of total travel time, length of average travel time)
* User statistics (e.g. subscriber vs. customer, gender, birth year)
